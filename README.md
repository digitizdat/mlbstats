### Convenience wrappers for working with the
[MLB-StatsAPI](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) package.
This package is a convenient way to grab data from the MLB Stats API, but the
data returned by it is not intuitive to me. I like working with Pandas, so I
created these wrapper functions to return the data in DataFrames and minimize
the column names to those you'd typically find in a baseball statistics
encyclopedia.

Check out the [notebook](notebook.ipynb) for examples.
